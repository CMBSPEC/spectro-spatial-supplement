These animations serve as a a supplement to

Spectro-spatial evolution of the CMB I: discretisation of the thermalisation Green's function
Spectro-spatial evolution of the CMB II: generalised Boltzmann hierarchy
Spectro-spatial evolution of the CMB III: transfer functions, power spectra and Fisher forecasts

We provide three animations of the greens function. The other animations show the transfer functions (top) and photon spectra (bottom).
All these animations are as seen in the scattering basis, except greens_y.mp4 which is in the computation basis.

The files each give the k value in Mpc-1, the injection redshift, and the multipole of the mode.
For the background we omit k and label the multipole as "bg".

In the folder labelled convergence we provide the various solutions for increasing N_max.

N_max only takes odd values (and 0). For clarity: N_max = { 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 }
For all the other spectra we only show N_max=15

Every spectrum shows the correctly scaled G(x), Y(x) and M(x) for reference.

Crucially the primordial temperature perturbations are subtracted for the anisotropic spectra, so the SD signal is not drowned out.
This means theta is only seen in the background animations, where this subtraction is not performed.
