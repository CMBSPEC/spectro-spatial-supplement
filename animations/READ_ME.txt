These animations serve as a a supplement to

Spectro-spatial evolution of the CMB I: discretisation of the thermalisation Green's function

We provide three animations of the greens function. The other animations ("injection spectra") show the transfer functions (top) and photon spectra (bottom).

All these animations are as seen in the scattering basis, except greens_y.mp4 which is in the computation basis.

The "injection spectra" files each give the injection redshift.

In the folder labelled convergence we provide the various solutions for increasing N_max.

N_max only takes odd values (and 0). For clarity: N_max = { 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 }
For all the other spectra we only show N_max=15

Every spectrum shows the correctly scaled G(x), Y(x) and M(x) for reference.
